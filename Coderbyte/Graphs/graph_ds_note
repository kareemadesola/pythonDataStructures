what is a graph
A data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges or the
connections between nodes
Typically, a visualization of a graph will be of nodes represented
by circles and edges as lines between the circles


Trees: A special kind of graph

Trees are just a special kind of graph with one root
and only one unique path between any two nodes

A graph can go beyond that and have any number of root elements
and multiple paths between nodes
